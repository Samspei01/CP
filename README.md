# Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome to my Competitive Programming (CP) solutions repository! Here, you will find my solutions to various competitive programming problems from multiple platforms like Codeforces, HackerRank, CodeChef, and others. This repository is organized to help both newcomers and seasoned competitors understand problem-solving strategies in competitive programming.

## Repository Structure

The solutions are categorized based on their difficulty level:
- **Easy**: Solutions that are suitable for beginners and typically involve basic problem-solving skills and algorithms.
- **Medium**: Solutions that require a good understanding of data structures and more complex algorithms.
- **Hard**: Advanced solutions that involve complex data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques.

Each problem is stored in its own file, named according to the problem's title, for instance, '276D_Little Girl and Maximum XOR.cpp.' Inside the source file, you can find a link to the original problem statement
